* Refactoring

- Get rid of as many short lived objects as possible to avoid lots of
   gabage collection - in particular look at how the Android
   Chronometer class is implemented and think about implementing our
   own version for counting down etc - also for hiding zoom controls
   in ContractionGraph too

* UI Changes

- Add seperate widgets to count into next contraction rather than
   reusing contraction length timer since is confusing to the user
